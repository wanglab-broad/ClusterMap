# FuseMap

Integrate multiple spatial transcripomics by generating universal gene, cell, and tissue embeddings.

- **Original scripts for generating data at ClusterMap paper are at: https://codeocean.com/capsule/9820099/tree/v1.**

- **STARmap placenta dataset can be accessed at [here](./datasets/STARmap_placenta/README.md).**

- **Raw fluorescent imaging data can be accessed at [here](./datasets/RawImage/README.md).**

### Install


> git clone https://github.com/wanglab-broad/ClusterMap.git
> 
> cd ClusterMap
> 
>pip install -e.

For the environment, to use .yml file:
`conda env create -f environment.yml`. This will create an environment named ClusterMap with required packages.

### Tutorial

- We are currently uploading more files for packaging and testing and will finish update soon.
- Read a more detailed tutorial [here](./Tutorial.md).

#### Basics

**Input data**

- `spots`: data matrix of mRNA spots with 2D/3D physical location and gene identity information (pandas dataframe)
  - Example

| Index | spot_location_1 | spot_location_2 | spot_location_3 | gene | Optional other info: gene_name |
| ----- | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :--: | :----------------------------: |
| 0     |       105       |       239       |        1        |  1   |            Syndig1l            |
| 1     |       110       |       243       |        1        |  1   |            Syndig1l            |
| 2     |       115       |       178       |        1        |  2   |             Acot13             |

- `dapi`: a 2D/3D image corronsponding to `spots`



**Input Parameters**

- `xy_radius`: estimation of radius of cells in x-y plane

- `z_radius`: estimation of radius of cells in z axis; 0 if data is 2D.

- `cell_num_threshold`:  a threshold for deciding the number of cells. A larger value gives more cells; Default: 0.1.

- `dapi_grid_interval`: sample interval in DAPI image. A large value will consume more computation resources and give more accurate results (most of the time). Default: 3.



**Output parameters**

- `model.cellid_unique`: unique cell id values

- `model.cellcenter_unique`:  cell centers in order of `model.cellid_unique`

#### Analysis on STARmap 3D V1 28-gene sample



#### Time estimation

- Time is dependent on the number of input spots, and potentially the area the DAPI foreground. Currently testing on several samples: 
  - 1mins 42s for 49,712 input spots (all 273,242 spots) without GPU, single thread
  - 34mins 53s for 471,295 input spots without GPU, single thread
